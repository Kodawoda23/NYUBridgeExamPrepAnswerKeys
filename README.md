This is a repo for NYU Bridge Exam prep. It contains pdfs of prior exams and answer keys. To add files, please send me your github accout so that I can add you as a collaborator.
To make corrections to answer keys, please create an issue that describes which answer is wrong and why, or have a discussion about it on the discord channel. If, after a discussion on the discord, the answer is still considered incorrect, the answer key can be corrected.
